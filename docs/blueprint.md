# **App Name**: AutoSim AI

## Core Features:

- Module Management: OTA Module Manager: Displays a table of test modules with details like module name, target, version, and release date. Offers options to initiate AI Testing, Flag modules, or Push to Car Simulator.
- Map Simulation: Interactive Map: Displays a map based on selected location. Allows users to draw routes and add waypoints representing local conditions.
- Condition Selection: Condition Control Panel: Features dropdowns to select road, weather, lighting, vehicle load, traffic, vehicle state, and infrastructure/connectivity conditions.
- Simulation Execution: Simulation Timeline: Animates a car icon along the defined route, simulating conditions, calling the backend for pass/fail results, and overlaying results on the route.
- Real-Time Testing: AI-Powered Testing: Employs an AI tool (via a Python sandbox) to analyze the module's performance under selected conditions and determine pass/fail status based on the conditions, module configurations and route characteristics.
- Results Display: Results Panel: Displays a matrix/table summarizing selected conditions, route segments, module details, and pass/fail status with failure reasons, allowing export as a PDF report.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) to convey a sense of technology and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), nearly white, providing a clean and modern backdrop for the simulation environment.
- Accent color: Teal (#38B2AC), an analogous hue to the primary, to highlight interactive elements and call to actions with a fresh, vibrant touch.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, to ensure a modern, objective, and neutral look across headlines and body text. 
- Use consistent and clear icons for various conditions and states within the simulation to enhance usability.
- Employ smooth animations for car movement along the route, progress bars, and warning popups to provide visual feedback and a polished user experience.
- Use a split-screen layout with the map simulation on one side and the condition control panel and results display on the other, optimizing screen real estate.
